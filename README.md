All the code I used for the project is executed and documented in this [notebook](). 

For the project i used anaconda to create an python environment with the following packages with versions:

numpy: 1.12.1
pandas: 0.23.3
matplotlib: 2.1.0
seaborn: 0.8.1
sklearn: 0.22.2.post1

No setup/startup is needed for the notebook to run.
